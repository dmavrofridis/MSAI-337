# MSAI-337
This is a public repository created for the MSAI-337 Natural Language Processing Course. During the duration of this course, our team completed a series of advanced homework assignments. Additionally, for the final project of this course our team has succesfully developed a conversational agent based on four different natural langiuage text generation models, using huggingface on the woz dataset. Furthermore, we have included a detailed analysis with specific metrics, such as Bleu scores and accuracy for each model, in order to gain a better understanding of which model performs best. To achieve our goal, our team decided to train and evaluate every model on the woz dataset using an AWS EC2 instance.
